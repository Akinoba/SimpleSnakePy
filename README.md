# SimpleSnakePy 🐍
An extremely simplified version of the game: Snake! This project uses turtle.py to draw to a tkinter window! 
Use W A S D to move the snake around the window! Press Q to exit the window...
Collect Food (red dots) within the playspace to gain points!

Currently there is no way to lose the game, the snake is indestructible!
You can traverse the entire window without losing!

This code is poorly optimized, feel free to modify and distribute!

Unfortunatly this program lacks emojis as IDLE would refuse to run with them 😞
